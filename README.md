# Java Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Java programming exercises organized by topic. Each program is a standalone `.java` file that can be compiled and run independently.

## Folder Structure

The exercises are organized into the following folders:

- **1_Basics:** Fundamental concepts like "Hello, World!", variable swapping, and basic calculations.
- **2_ControlStatements:** Programs demonstrating `if-else`, `switch-case`, and other control flow statements.
- **3_Loops:** Exercises using `for` and `while` loops, such as factorial, Fibonacci, and prime number generation.
- **4_Arrays:** Programs for array manipulation, including sorting, searching, and finding largest/smallest elements.
- **5_Strings:** String manipulation exercises like palindrome checking, vowel counting, and anagrams.
- **6_Methods:** Programs that demonstrate the use of methods for code organization and reusability.
- **7_OOP:** Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including classes, objects, constructors, and method overloading/overriding.
- **8_Inheritance_Polymorphism:** Advanced OOP topics like inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.

## How to Compile and Run the Programs

To compile and run the Java programs, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Compiling a Program

To compile a Java file, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the `javac` command:

```bash
javac YourProgramName.java
```

For example, to compile the `HelloWorld.java` program in the `1_Basics` folder:

```bash
cd 1_Basics
javac HelloWorld.java
```

This will create a `YourProgramName.class` file in the same directory.

### Running a Program

Once the program is compiled, you can run it using the `java` command, followed by the class name (without the `.class` extension):

```bash
java YourProgramName
```

For example, to run the `HelloWorld` program:

```bash
java HelloWorld
```

You will see the output of the program in the terminal.
